## üìå About the project

### This system was developed so that events at Fatec Itu - Dom Amaury College can be streamed. Castanho could have a more practical registration method, making it easier for students, outsiders, and event organizers. Clearly, this system is also used by event organizers for management, monitoring, etc.

### üë• This system is being created by: Guilherme Francisco Pereira as a final project development / Real system

### ‚ú® Interesting fact!! This is the only student-developed system that is implemented and used by the college, both by students and professors, coordinators, and more!

## üõéÔ∏è Updates to this commit

### `./src/modules/categories/categories.service.ts:` Fixed the `findAllPublic` function where it correctly only brought categories that had at least 1 event, however, if the event had the maximum number of participants and it was not possible to see it on the front, it still brought the category to the front filter, fixed that.

### All project source code files are in: `./src` and E2E tests are in: `./test`

## üõà How the project is structured

    - `schema.prisma:` This is the central file where we define the Prisma Client's data models, relationships, and generators.

- `./src/app.module.ts`: Root module that declares/imports the application's other modules, controllers, and providers.
- `./src/main.ts`: Application entry point, where Nest is initialized and configured.

- `./src/assets:` directory to organize additional static resources.
    - `readme:` Folder that will store our photos for use in the documentation ( README )

## ‚ùî How do I run the project on my machine?

- First of all, you need to have Git installed on your computer. Git is a tool that allows you to clone and manage code repositories.
- Windows: Download Git <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win" target="_blank">here</a> and follow the installation instructions. - macOS: You can install Git <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/mac" target="_blank">here</a> or using Homebrew with the brew install git command:
    ```bash
    brew install git
    ```

- Linux: Use your distribution's package manager, for example, for Debian/Ubuntu:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install git
    ```

- Open a terminal (on Windows, you can use Git Bash, which is installed along with Git).

- Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.

- Run the command to clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GuilhermeFranciscoPereira/Eventos_Fatec_Itu-Back-End.git
    ```

- After cloning the repository, navigate to the project folder.
    ```bash
    cd Eventos_Fatec_Itu-Back-End.git
    ```

- Now you can open the project files with your preferred text editor or IDE. Example:
    ```bash
    code .
    ```

- üö® Don't forget that to avoid errors in the code when cloning it, you must run the command below: üö®
    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

- üö® To avoid errors, you must also update Prisma for your database. To do this, run the command below before running the code! üö®
    ```bash
    npx prisma generate
    ```

- Once you have the project on your machine, open the website. To do this, follow the steps below:
    - Remember to create the .env file based on everything contained in the file: `.env.example`
    - Open the terminal and write the code below to start the website:
        ```bash
        npm run start:dev
        ```

##

## üê≥ Docker Commands

### After the 3 files, we generate the Docker image and run it:
``` bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

### This will:
- Start the MySQL container (db)
- Launch Nest (app)

### Check that the container is actually up and has the port mapped

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

### Open the port that appears, for example:

```bash
http://localhost:xxxx
```

### To restart the backend when changing the code:

```bash
docker-compose restart backend_events-fatec-itu
```

### To restart the database when changing the code:

```bash
docker-compose restart db_events-fatec-itu
```

### To restart everything at once:

```bash
docker-compose restart
```

### Stop only the db

```bash
docker-compose stop db_events-fatec-itu
```

### Stop only the backend

```bash
docker-compose stop backend_events-fatec-itu
```

### If you want to remove the container (in addition to stopping it), use rm:

```bash
docker-compose rm db
```

```bash
docker-compose rm backend
```
### When you want to stop everything at once:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

### If you want the 'hot reload' to always update with changes, you can change the `docker-compose.yml` and add:

```bash 
volumes: 
- ./:/app 
- /app/node_modules 
command: npm run start:dev
```

##

## üß™ How to run unit and End-To-End (e2e) tests?

### Unit tests: you have two options: run all unit tests at once or one at a time.

- `All unit tests at once:`

```bash
npm run test
```

- `Testing a specific unit test:` Command: `npx jest` followed by the module name, for example, `users`, and the file name, for example, `users.service.spec.ts`, always respecting the folder hierarchy. If the modules are inside a modules folder, this should be included after src.
    - It should look like this:
    ```bash
    npx jest src/modules/users/users.service.spec.ts
    ```

### End-to-End (e2e) Tests:

- To run e2e tests, you just need to write one command, and it will perform the entire application test with success and failure cases:
    ```bash
    npm run test:e2e
    ```
