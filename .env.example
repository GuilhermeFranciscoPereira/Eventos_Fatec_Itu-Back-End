# This is an example environment file (.env.example).
# It demonstrates how your real environment variables (.env) should be structured.

# To set up your actual environment file, follow these steps:
# 1. Duplicate this file and rename it to ".env".
# 2. Fill in the required values specific to your environment.
# 3. Never commit your ".env" file to version control. It must be private and kept secure.

# I Guilherme recommend use two .env -> The first to development mode and the second to production.
# So, copy that example and create two .env -> .env // .env.production
